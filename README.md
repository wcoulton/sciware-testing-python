[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/wcoulton/sciware-testing-python/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=KDXOJF7JTB)](https://codecov.io/gh/wcoulton/sciware-testing-python)
This is an example repository for writing tests, for the Sciware Testing session. 
It demonstrates how to setup a repository to use GitHub actions to automatically run tests
on the code.

## Quick-start

### Prerequisites

- python3 with pip3 (with optional virtualenv or conda)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flatironinstitute/sciware-testing-python.git
cd sciware-testing-python
pip3 install -e .
```

This will work with a virtualenv, conda, or on a personal machine.
With a system python, you may need `pip3 install --user -e .`.
This will also install dependencies (like `pytest`) specified in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

The `-e` indicates that we want to continue developing (editing) the installed package.

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Forking This Project

If you fork this project you should do the following things to make sure that your fork is correctly linked to your GitHub account:

1.  If you haven't linked your GitHub account to [`codecov`](https://about.codecov.io/), do so now.
2.  Change the badge URL at the top of `README.md` to point to your GitHub workflow build. To do this, replace `flatironinstitute` with your GitHub handle in the URLs of the badge.
3.  Change the badge URL at the top of `README.md` to point to your [`codecov`](https://about.codecov.io/) report. Go to [`codecov`](https://about.codecov.io/), navigate to the `sciware-testing-python` project, then go to Settings > Badge.
4.  Change your [`codecov`](https://about.codecov.io/) token in your GitHub actions file (in `.github/workflows`). To get your token go to [`codecov`](https://about.codecov.io/), navigate to the `sciware-testing-python` project, then go to Settings > General > `Repository Upload Token`. Copy this token and use it to set the `CODECOV_TOKEN` variable in `.github/workflows`.
